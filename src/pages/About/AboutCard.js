            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Rubayat Imran </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Dhaka, Bangladesh.</span>
            <br />
            I am an experienced front-end developer and an Optimizely-certified CRO (A/B testing) expert with a passion for writing high-quality code and delivering bug-free tests. I bring over 5 years of experience in building high-quality, performant websites and applications using modern tools and frameworks such as React, Redux, JavaScript, TypeScript, jQuery, Sass/Less, Bootstrap, and other frontend libraries.
            <br />
            I enjoy learning new things and keeping up with the latest in technology. My goal is always to deliver high-quality and efficient solutions that make a difference.
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
